# ML Intern Task 
<p>A basic Machine learning project for learning several supervised and unsupervised learning methods.</p>
### I performed:
- EDA on the dataset
- in total 5 supervised models
  + logistic regression
  + Decision tree
  + Linear SVC
  + SVM
  + k-nearest
- 1 unsupervised approach
  + k-means
- 3 ensembled methods
  + Random Forest
  + Gradient Boosting
  + XGBoost
### About The dataset
<p>It's from kaggle named ECG Heartbeat Categorization Dataset. The dataset is a combination of two databases named the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset and The PTB Diagnostic ECG Database. Both are resided in physionet.org</p>
